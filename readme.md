## HighLowPoint

Aggregating a number of profiles into one to find highest/lowest point, distance and height difference.

### Description

Shows how the Profile API can be used to calculate three different mean profiles and find the highest and lowest point. The distance between the points and the height difference.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the profiles after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
